This is a matlab program for robust attitude estimation using inertial and magnetic sensors.

1. For a very brief explanation of the proposed algorithm, please see "algorithm.pdf".
(An article containing the detailed algorithm is in https://uouisl.wordpress.com/research/)
("l1 norm regularization robust attitude smoother using inertial and magnetic sensors")

2. Main matlab file is "mainmatlab.m".  Run the file with different "simulation_mode" and "data_num" values
(see the explanation inside the m file)
